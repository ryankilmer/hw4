Second Idea: Digital DJ!

Premise: An interactive set of DJ turntables where users can mix songs together. The top of the turntables feature a 
track select button where users can select from 4 pre-included songs. In the middle of the screen, the slider for individual track volume. There is a slider on the bottom that can control the mix between the two songs. A set of play/pause buttons are below the turntables. I might add an effects panel if I can figure it out.
