First Idea: Trivia Tower!

Premise: An old-school style game with retro music and sound effects.
Players can choose between "free play mode", where they choose their own category and level of difficulty
or "challenge mode", where they have to work their way up through five levels of the trivia tower. Each level will get progressively more difficult. The format of the game will be similar to quiz games, with four options to choose from for each question, and a lifeline button that eliminates two wrong answers. I also want to include a scoreboard / high score screen so friends can compete against each other.
